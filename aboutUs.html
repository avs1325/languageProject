                    <p>
                        Serenity - an association created by 4 teenagers. The roots of our tree, our simple, innovative idea; was first 
                        born a few years back. At first, it was a seemingly small pitch for our English Language term project, a creative
                        venture. And yet, that's where most opportunities rise - at a simple idea, a creative venture. With great thought,
                        contemplation, and reflection, we finally decided to journey further; upwards and beyond! It is with utmost appreciation
                         we say that we are infinitely grateful to our English Language teacher - Mr. Suryasubha Bannerjee - without whom we 
                         would not have been able to water the roots of our tree, without whom, we would not have been able to grow.

                    <h1>Why we do this</h1>
                    <p>
                        When we took our first small steps as an association, everything appeared strangely new to us,in a manner that
                        caused us to be both anxious, and excited. The first steps gave us a view into the window of the world out there, 
                        aspects that we had yet to learn about. We could not be happier of our progress, of creating a platform which helps 
                        us to provide utmost ease for others to give; to donate to causes of their choices and interest.
                        <br>
                        We abundantly thank those that helped us, our journey would not have been possible if it wasn't for everybody out 
                        there contributing their time and effort for those in unfortunate circumstances, for showing so much compassion 
                        and concern. Because of all of you, we were able to progress; from little steps to big leaps; from stubby roots 
                        to ample trees. We ask of you one last thing. Please, help us grow further; help those out in dire need. Help us 
                        to change, to improve, to save lives.
